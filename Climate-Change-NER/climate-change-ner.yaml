doc_to_text: "Identify climate-related entities in the given text and return the results in structured JSON format.

Expected JSON Output Format:
{
  \"<NER-TYPE1>\": [\"<entity_1>\", \"<entity_2>\", \"<entity_3>\"],
  \"<NER-TYPE2>\": [\"<entity_4>\"]
  ...
}

  Entity Categories and Definitions:
  
  - climate-assets: Physical or economic resources vulnerable to climate hazards, such as health, buildings, infrastructure, crops, and livestock. \n
  - climate-datasets: Named collections of climate-related data, including observations, models, historical records, or reanalysis datasets.\n
  - climate-greenhouse-gases: Gases contributing to atmospheric warming, such as carbon dioxide and methane.\n
  - climate-hazards: Climate-related dangers with potential negative impacts, such as floods, wildfires, droughts, and heatwaves.\n
  - climate-impacts: Consequences of climate hazards, particularly negative effects on humans, livestock, or ecosystems.\n
  - climate-mitigations: Actions aimed at reducing climate change or adapting to its consequences.\n
  - climate-models: Computational models used for climate analysis and prediction, including physical, mathematical, and AI-based models.\n
  - climate-nature: Non-living aspects of nature, such as oceans, rivers, atmosphere, winds, and snow.\n
  - climate-observations: Tools and instruments used for climate monitoring, such as satellites, spectrometers, and rain gauges.\n
  - climate-organisms: Living organisms, including plants and animals, that are relevant to climate studies.\n
  - climate-organizations: Institutions or groups with climate-related interests or initiatives.\n
  - climate-problem-origins: Factors contributing to climate change, such as fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial sectors consuming energy.\n
  - climate-properties: Climate characteristics, often expressed with measurable values and units.\n

  Instructions:
  - Each token can be assigned a maximum of one entity type.
  - When a hazard is explicitly described in detail, annotate the full term (e.g., `\"surface water flood\"` instead of just `\"flood\"`).
  - Ensure that the JSON output **only** contains a valid dictionary structure without extra text, incorrect formatting, or enclosing quotation marks.
